The Opus codec is designed for interactive speech and audio transmission over the Internet. It is designed by the IETF Codec Working Group and incorporates technology from Skype\textquotesingle{}s SILK codec and Xiph.\+Org\textquotesingle{}s CELT codec.

The Opus codec is designed to handle a wide range of interactive audio applications, including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-\/game chat, and even remote live music performances. It can scale from low bit-\/rate narrowband speech to very high quality stereo music. Its main features are\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sampling rates from 8 to 48 k\+Hz \item Bit-\/rates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s \item Support for both constant bit-\/rate (CBR) and variable bit-\/rate (VBR) \item Audio bandwidth from narrowband to full-\/band \item Support for speech and music \item Support for mono and stereo \item Support for multichannel (up to 255 channels) \item Frame sizes from 2.\+5 ms to 60 ms \item Good loss robustness and packet loss concealment (PLC) \item Floating point and fixed-\/point implementation\end{DoxyItemize}
